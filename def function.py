# Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
# Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.
# You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
# The following example has a function with one argument (firstname).
# When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:
def myfunc(fname):
  print(fname + " Amin")

myfunc("Arjun")
myfunc("Saloni")
myfunc("Hreem")
